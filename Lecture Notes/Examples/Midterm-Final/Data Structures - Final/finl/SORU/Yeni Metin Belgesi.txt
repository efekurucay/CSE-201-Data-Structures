Solution A :

Load Factor = Total elements to be chained / Total hashing index.

In this case,

Total 13 elements to be chained and we have indices from 0 to 14 ,that is 15

So, load factor = 13/15

Diagram of table after chaining shown below




Solution D :

Load factor in chaining = 13/15

Load factor in linera probing = 13/15

Load factor in double hashing = 12/15
