### Analysis Of Algorithms
- Running times
- Space usage 

### Experimental Analysis
- Trial and error approach
- it is costly

### Theoric Approach
- Number of operatoin according to input size of n
- Worst case
- Best case

### Counting Primitives
- Like assignment, comparison, arithmetic op. etc.
- The growth rate is not affected by 
  * constant
  * factor

### Big-Oh Notation
